# Console-Case-Study

**Backgound Info**

This was a passion project I wanted to look into after completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. As someone who's personally interested in video games, my goal was to investigate any trends and performance in older games between 2008 and early 2017. There is a common sentiment between gamers that modern games haven't been as impactful as they used to be. 

**Tools**

1. R programming
2. tidyverse
3. ggplot2
   
For this project, I wanted to practice using R in order to further familiarize myself with the coding language. So this project was both a passion project and a way to challenge myself. 

**Conclusion**

Using ggplot2 I made visuals depicting the performance of the top 50 games on each platform. A common trend I found was that even during the early 2010s, the most popular genres across the board were action, shooter, and sports. My suggestion to these three companies is to take a step back and recall the formulas that allowed earlier games to become so massively popular to begin with as well as utilize indie developers to get a better understanding of market trends in order to capitalize on bringing in a wider audience.
